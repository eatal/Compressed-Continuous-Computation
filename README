Compressed Continuous Computation (C3)
-------------------------------------

The Compressed Continuous Computation (C3) package is intended to make it easy to perform continuous linear and multilinear algebra with multidimensional functions. Common tasks include taking "matrix" decompositions of vector- or matrix-valued functions, adding or multiplying functions together, integrating multidimensional functions, and much much more.
